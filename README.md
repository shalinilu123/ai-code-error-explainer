# 🤖 AI Code Error Explainer
### A Semantic Search–Based Error Understanding System

---

## 📌 Overview

AI Code Error Explainer is a semantic search–based application designed to help
developers understand programming errors using **natural language input**.

Instead of relying on exact error names or keyword matching, this project uses
**vector embeddings** to capture the meaning of an error description and retrieve
the most relevant explanations across multiple programming languages.

The project is built as a **practical AI/ML use case**, demonstrating how vector
databases and semantic similarity can be applied to real-world developer problems.

---

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- Semantic search using vector embeddings  
- Natural language error input (no exact keywords required)  
- Top-3 ranked error matches with confidence interpretation  
- Cross-language support (Python, Java, C++, SQL)  
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit  
- Lightweight and fast local execution

## 🧠 System Architecture

The project follows a simple but effective pipeline:

**1. Error Knowledge Base**  
A curated set of programming errors with explanations and fixes.

**2. Vector Embedding Generation**  
Each error description is converted into a numerical vector using a
pre-trained sentence embedding model.

**3. Similarity Search**  
User input is embedded and compared against stored vectors using
cosine similarity.

**4. Ranking & Interpretation**  
Results are ranked by similarity and presented with
human-readable confidence levels.

**5. User Interface**  
A Streamlit-based UI allows users to interact with the system easily.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Sentence Transformers** – semantic text embeddings
- **Scikit-learn** – cosine similarity computation
- **Streamlit** – interactive UI
- **Endee** – vector database concept and integration reference

## 🔗 Endee Integration Context

This project is developed inside a **forked Endee repository** and follows
vector database principles inspired by Endee’s architecture.

While Endee itself is a **high-performance C++ vector database engine**, this
project focuses on:

- Demonstrating how vector embeddings are generated  
- How similarity-based retrieval works  
- How such workflows integrate conceptually with a vector database system like Endee

## 🧪 Example Usage

**User Input (Natural English):**
my program crashes when accessing array index

**System Output (Top Matches):**
- Java – ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  
- C++ – Segmentation Fault  
- Python – IndexError  

This demonstrates **semantic understanding across different languages and error types**.
